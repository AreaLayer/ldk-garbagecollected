/**
 * A lightning node's channel state machine and payment management logic, which facilitates
 * sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through lightning channels.
 * 
 * [`ChannelManager`] is parameterized by a number of components to achieve this.
 * - [`chain::Watch`] (typically [`ChainMonitor`]) for on-chain monitoring and enforcement of each
 * channel
 * - [`BroadcasterInterface`] for broadcasting transactions related to opening, funding, and
 * closing channels
 * - [`EntropySource`] for providing random data needed for cryptographic operations
 * - [`NodeSigner`] for cryptographic operations scoped to the node
 * - [`SignerProvider`] for providing signers whose operations are scoped to individual channels
 * - [`FeeEstimator`] to determine transaction fee rates needed to have a transaction mined in a
 * timely manner
 * - [`Router`] for finding payment paths when initiating and retrying payments
 * - [`MessageRouter`] for finding message paths when initiating and retrying onion messages
 * - [`Logger`] for logging operational information of varying degrees
 * 
 * Additionally, it implements the following traits:
 * - [`ChannelMessageHandler`] to handle off-chain channel activity from peers
 * - [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] to similarly send such messages to peers
 * - [`OffersMessageHandler`] for BOLT 12 message handling and sending
 * - [`EventsProvider`] to generate user-actionable [`Event`]s
 * - [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for notification of on-chain activity
 * 
 * Thus, [`ChannelManager`] is typically used to parameterize a [`MessageHandler`] and an
 * [`OnionMessenger`]. The latter is required to support BOLT 12 functionality.
 * 
 * # `ChannelManager` vs `ChannelMonitor`
 * 
 * It's important to distinguish between the *off-chain* management and *on-chain* enforcement of
 * lightning channels. [`ChannelManager`] exchanges messages with peers to manage the off-chain
 * state of each channel. During this process, it generates a [`ChannelMonitor`] for each channel
 * and a [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] for each relevant change, notifying its parameterized
 * [`chain::Watch`] of them.
 * 
 * An implementation of [`chain::Watch`], such as [`ChainMonitor`], is responsible for aggregating
 * these [`ChannelMonitor`]s and applying any [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`]s to them. It then monitors
 * for any pertinent on-chain activity, enforcing claims as needed.
 * 
 * This division of off-chain management and on-chain enforcement allows for interesting node
 * setups. For instance, on-chain enforcement could be moved to a separate host or have added
 * redundancy, possibly as a watchtower. See [`chain::Watch`] for the relevant interface.
 * 
 * # Initialization
 * 
 * Use [`ChannelManager::new`] with the most recent [`BlockHash`] when creating a fresh instance.
 * Otherwise, if restarting, construct [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] with the necessary parameters and
 * references to any deserialized [`ChannelMonitor`]s that were previously persisted. Use this to
 * deserialize the [`ChannelManager`] and feed it any new chain data since it was last online, as
 * detailed in the [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] documentation.
 *

 * for monitor in channel_monitors {
 * chain_monitor.watch_channel(monitor.get_funding_txo().0, monitor);
 * }
 * # Ok(())
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * # Operation
 * 
 * The following is required for [`ChannelManager`] to function properly:
 * - Handle messages from peers using its [`ChannelMessageHandler`] implementation (typically
 * called by [`PeerManager::read_event`] when processing network I/O)
 * - Send messages to peers obtained via its [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] implementation
 * (typically initiated when [`PeerManager::process_events`] is called)
 * - Feed on-chain activity using either its [`chain::Listen`] or [`chain::Confirm`] implementation
 * as documented by those traits
 * - Perform any periodic channel and payment checks by calling [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly
 * every minute
 * - Persist to disk whenever [`get_and_clear_needs_persistence`] returns `true` using a
 * [`Persister`] such as a [`KVStore`] implementation
 * - Handle [`Event`]s obtained via its [`EventsProvider`] implementation
 * 
 * The [`Future`] returned by [`get_event_or_persistence_needed_future`] is useful in determining
 * when the last two requirements need to be checked.
 * 
 * The [`lightning-block-sync`] and [`lightning-transaction-sync`] crates provide utilities that
 * simplify feeding in on-chain activity using the [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] traits,
 * respectively. The remaining requirements can be met using the [`lightning-background-processor`]
 * crate. For languages other than Rust, the availability of similar utilities may vary.
 * 
 * # Channels
 * 
 * [`ChannelManager`]'s primary function involves managing a channel state. Without channels,
 * payments can't be sent. Use [`list_channels`] or [`list_usable_channels`] for a snapshot of the
 * currently open channels.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let channels = channel_manager.list_usable_channels();
 * for details in channels {
 * println!(\"{:?}\", details);
 * }
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * Each channel is identified using a [`ChannelId`], which will change throughout the channel's
 * life cycle. Additionally, channels are assigned a `user_channel_id`, which is given in
 * [`Event`]s associated with the channel and serves as a fixed identifier but is otherwise unused
 * by [`ChannelManager`].
 * 
 * ## Opening Channels
 * 
 * To an open a channel with a peer, call [`create_channel`]. This will initiate the process of
 * opening an outbound channel, which requires self-funding when handling
 * [`Event::FundingGenerationReady`].
 * 
 * ```
 * # use bitcoin::{ScriptBuf, Transaction};
 * # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * #
 * # trait Wallet {
 * #     fn create_funding_transaction(
 * #         &self, _amount_sats: u64, _output_script: ScriptBuf
 * #     ) -> Transaction;
 * # }
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager, W: Wallet>(channel_manager: T, wallet: W, peer_id: PublicKey) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let value_sats = 1_000_000;
 * let push_msats = 10_000_000;
 * match channel_manager.create_channel(peer_id, value_sats, push_msats, 42, None, None) {
 * Ok(channel_id) => println!(\"Opening channel {}\", channel_id),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Error opening channel: {:?}\", e),
 * }
 * 
 * On the event processing thread once the peer has responded
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::FundingGenerationReady {
 * temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, channel_value_satoshis, output_script,
 * user_channel_id, ..
 * } => {
 * assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
 * let funding_transaction = wallet.create_funding_transaction(
 * channel_value_satoshis, output_script
 * );
 * match channel_manager.funding_transaction_generated(
 * temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, funding_transaction
 * ) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Funding channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Error funding channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
 * }
 * },
 * Event::ChannelPending { channel_id, user_channel_id, former_temporary_channel_id, .. } => {
 * assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
 * println!(
 * \"Channel {} now {} pending (funding transaction has been broadcasted)\", channel_id,
 * former_temporary_channel_id.unwrap()
 * );
 * },
 * Event::ChannelReady { channel_id, user_channel_id, .. } => {
 * assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
 * println!(\"Channel {} ready\", channel_id);
 * },
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Accepting Channels
 * 
 * Inbound channels are initiated by peers and are automatically accepted unless [`ChannelManager`]
 * has [`UserConfig::manually_accept_inbound_channels`] set. In that case, the channel may be
 * either accepted or rejected when handling [`Event::OpenChannelRequest`].
 * 
 * ```
 * # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * #
 * # fn is_trusted(counterparty_node_id: PublicKey) -> bool {
 * #     // ...
 * #     unimplemented!()
 * # }
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * # let error_message = \"Channel force-closed\";
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::OpenChannelRequest { temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, ..  } => {
 * if !is_trusted(counterparty_node_id) {
 * match channel_manager.force_close_without_broadcasting_txn(
 * &temporary_channel_id, &counterparty_node_id, error_message.to_string()
 * ) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Rejecting channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Error rejecting channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
 * }
 * return Ok(());
 * }
 * 
 * let user_channel_id = 43;
 * match channel_manager.accept_inbound_channel(
 * &temporary_channel_id, &counterparty_node_id, user_channel_id
 * ) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Accepting channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Error accepting channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
 * }
 * },
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Closing Channels
 * 
 * There are two ways to close a channel: either cooperatively using [`close_channel`] or
 * unilaterally using [`force_close_broadcasting_latest_txn`]. The former is ideal as it makes for
 * lower fees and immediate access to funds. However, the latter may be necessary if the
 * counterparty isn't behaving properly or has gone offline. [`Event::ChannelClosed`] is generated
 * once the channel has been closed successfully.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
 * # use lightning::ln::types::ChannelId;
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(
 * #     channel_manager: T, channel_id: ChannelId, counterparty_node_id: PublicKey
 * # ) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * match channel_manager.close_channel(&channel_id, &counterparty_node_id) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Closing channel {}\", channel_id),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Error closing channel {}: {:?}\", channel_id, e),
 * }
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::ChannelClosed { channel_id, user_channel_id, ..  } => {
 * assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
 * println!(\"Channel {} closed\", channel_id);
 * },
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * # Payments
 * 
 * [`ChannelManager`] is responsible for sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through its
 * channels. A payment is typically initiated from a [BOLT 11] invoice or a [BOLT 12] offer, though
 * spontaneous (i.e., keysend) payments are also possible. Incoming payments don't require
 * maintaining any additional state as [`ChannelManager`] can reconstruct the [`PaymentPreimage`]
 * from the [`PaymentSecret`]. Sending payments, however, require tracking in order to retry failed
 * HTLCs.
 * 
 * After a payment is initiated, it will appear in [`list_recent_payments`] until a short time
 * after either an [`Event::PaymentSent`] or [`Event::PaymentFailed`] is handled. Failed HTLCs
 * for a payment will be retried according to the payment's [`Retry`] strategy or until
 * [`abandon_payment`] is called.
 * 
 * ## BOLT 11 Invoices
 * 
 * The [`lightning-invoice`] crate is useful for creating BOLT 11 invoices. However, in order to
 * construct a [`Bolt11Invoice`] that is compatible with [`ChannelManager`], use
 * [`create_bolt11_invoice`]. This method serves as a convenience for building invoices with the
 * [`PaymentHash`] and [`PaymentSecret`] returned from [`create_inbound_payment`]. To provide your
 * own [`PaymentHash`], override the appropriate [`Bolt11InvoiceParameters`], which is equivalent
 * to using [`create_inbound_payment_for_hash`].
 * 
 * [`ChannelManager`] generates an [`Event::PaymentClaimable`] once the full payment has been
 * received. Call [`claim_funds`] to release the [`PaymentPreimage`], which in turn will result in
 * an [`Event::PaymentClaimed`].
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider, PaymentPurpose};
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::{AChannelManager, Bolt11InvoiceParameters};
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let params = Bolt11InvoiceParameters {
 * amount_msats: Some(10_000_000),
 * invoice_expiry_delta_secs: Some(3600),
 * ..Default::default()
 * };
 * let invoice = match channel_manager.create_bolt11_invoice(params) {
 * Ok(invoice) => {
 * println!(\"Creating invoice with payment hash {}\", invoice.payment_hash());
 * invoice
 * },
 * Err(e) => panic!(\"Error creating invoice: {}\", e),
 * };
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::PaymentClaimable { payment_hash, purpose, .. } => match purpose {
 * PaymentPurpose::Bolt11InvoicePayment { payment_preimage: Some(payment_preimage), .. } => {
 * assert_eq!(payment_hash.0, invoice.payment_hash().as_ref());
 * println!(\"Claiming payment {}\", payment_hash);
 * channel_manager.claim_funds(payment_preimage);
 * },
 * PaymentPurpose::Bolt11InvoicePayment { payment_preimage: None, .. } => {
 * println!(\"Unknown payment hash: {}\", payment_hash);
 * },
 * PaymentPurpose::SpontaneousPayment(payment_preimage) => {
 * assert_ne!(payment_hash.0, invoice.payment_hash().as_ref());
 * println!(\"Claiming spontaneous payment {}\", payment_hash);
 * channel_manager.claim_funds(payment_preimage);
 * },
 * ...
 * #           _ => {},
 * },
 * Event::PaymentClaimed { payment_hash, amount_msat, .. } => {
 * assert_eq!(payment_hash.0, invoice.payment_hash().as_ref());
 * println!(\"Claimed {} msats\", amount_msat);
 * },
 * ...
 * #       _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * For paying an invoice, see the [`bolt11_payment`] module with convenience functions for use with
 * [`send_payment`].
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * # use lightning::types::payment::PaymentHash;
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::{AChannelManager, PaymentId, RecentPaymentDetails};
 * # use lightning::ln::outbound_payment::{RecipientOnionFields, Retry};
 * # use lightning::routing::router::RouteParameters;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(
 * #     channel_manager: T, payment_hash: PaymentHash, recipient_onion: RecipientOnionFields,
 * #     route_params: RouteParameters, retry: Retry
 * # ) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let (payment_hash, recipient_onion, route_params) =
 * payment::payment_parameters_from_invoice(&invoice);
 * let payment_id = PaymentId([42; 32]);
 * match channel_manager.send_payment(
 * payment_hash, recipient_onion, payment_id, route_params, retry
 * ) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Sending payment with hash {}\", payment_hash),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Failed sending payment with hash {}: {:?}\", payment_hash, e),
 * }
 * 
 * let expected_payment_id = payment_id;
 * let expected_payment_hash = payment_hash;
 * assert!(
 * channel_manager.list_recent_payments().iter().find(|details| matches!(
 * details,
 * RecentPaymentDetails::Pending {
 * payment_id: expected_payment_id,
 * payment_hash: expected_payment_hash,
 * ..
 * }
 * )).is_some()
 * );
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::PaymentSent { payment_hash, .. } => println!(\"Paid {}\", payment_hash),
 * Event::PaymentFailed { payment_hash: Some(payment_hash), .. } =>
 * println!(\"Failed paying {}\", payment_hash),
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## BOLT 12 Offers
 * 
 * The [`offers`] module is useful for creating BOLT 12 offers. An [`Offer`] is a precursor to a
 * [`Bolt12Invoice`], which must first be requested by the payer. The interchange of these messages
 * as defined in the specification is handled by [`ChannelManager`] and its implementation of
 * [`OffersMessageHandler`]. However, this only works with an [`Offer`] created using a builder
 * returned by [`create_offer_builder`]. With this approach, BOLT 12 offers and invoices are
 * stateless just as BOLT 11 invoices are.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider, PaymentPurpose};
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * # use lightning::offers::parse::Bolt12SemanticError;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) -> Result<(), Bolt12SemanticError> {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * # let absolute_expiry = None;
 * let offer = channel_manager
 * .create_offer_builder(absolute_expiry)?
 * # ;
 * # // Needed for compiling for c_bindings
 * # let builder: lightning::offers::offer::OfferBuilder<_, _> = offer.into();
 * # let offer = builder
 * .description(\"coffee\".to_string())
 * .amount_msats(10_000_000)
 * .build()?;
 * let bech32_offer = offer.to_string();
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::PaymentClaimable { payment_hash, purpose, .. } => match purpose {
 * PaymentPurpose::Bolt12OfferPayment { payment_preimage: Some(payment_preimage), .. } => {
 * println!(\"Claiming payment {}\", payment_hash);
 * channel_manager.claim_funds(payment_preimage);
 * },
 * PaymentPurpose::Bolt12OfferPayment { payment_preimage: None, .. } => {
 * println!(\"Unknown payment hash: {}\", payment_hash);
 * }
 * #           _ => {},
 * },
 * Event::PaymentClaimed { payment_hash, amount_msat, .. } => {
 * println!(\"Claimed {} msats\", amount_msat);
 * },
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # Ok(())
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * Use [`pay_for_offer`] to initiated payment, which sends an [`InvoiceRequest`] for an [`Offer`]
 * and pays the [`Bolt12Invoice`] response.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::{AChannelManager, PaymentId, RecentPaymentDetails};
 * # use lightning::ln::outbound_payment::Retry;
 * # use lightning::offers::offer::Offer;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(
 * #     channel_manager: T, offer: &Offer, quantity: Option<u64>, amount_msats: Option<u64>,
 * #     payer_note: Option<String>, retry: Retry, max_total_routing_fee_msat: Option<u64>
 * # ) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let payment_id = PaymentId([42; 32]);
 * match channel_manager.pay_for_offer(
 * offer, quantity, amount_msats, payer_note, payment_id, retry, max_total_routing_fee_msat
 * ) {
 * Ok(()) => println!(\"Requesting invoice for offer\"),
 * Err(e) => println!(\"Unable to request invoice for offer: {:?}\", e),
 * }
 * 
 * First the payment will be waiting on an invoice
 * let expected_payment_id = payment_id;
 * assert!(
 * channel_manager.list_recent_payments().iter().find(|details| matches!(
 * details,
 * RecentPaymentDetails::AwaitingInvoice { payment_id: expected_payment_id }
 * )).is_some()
 * );
 * 
 * Once the invoice is received, a payment will be sent
 * assert!(
 * channel_manager.list_recent_payments().iter().find(|details| matches!(
 * details,
 * RecentPaymentDetails::Pending { payment_id: expected_payment_id, ..  }
 * )).is_some()
 * );
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::PaymentSent { payment_id: Some(payment_id), .. } => println!(\"Paid {}\", payment_id),
 * Event::PaymentFailed { payment_id, .. } => println!(\"Failed paying {}\", payment_id),
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## BOLT 12 Refunds
 * 
 * A [`Refund`] is a request for an invoice to be paid. Like *paying* for an [`Offer`], *creating*
 * a [`Refund`] involves maintaining state since it represents a future outbound payment.
 * Therefore, use [`create_refund_builder`] when creating one, otherwise [`ChannelManager`] will
 * refuse to pay any corresponding [`Bolt12Invoice`] that it receives.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use core::time::Duration;
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::{AChannelManager, PaymentId, RecentPaymentDetails};
 * # use lightning::ln::outbound_payment::Retry;
 * # use lightning::offers::parse::Bolt12SemanticError;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(
 * #     channel_manager: T, amount_msats: u64, absolute_expiry: Duration, retry: Retry,
 * #     max_total_routing_fee_msat: Option<u64>
 * # ) -> Result<(), Bolt12SemanticError> {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let payment_id = PaymentId([42; 32]);
 * let refund = channel_manager
 * .create_refund_builder(
 * amount_msats, absolute_expiry, payment_id, retry, max_total_routing_fee_msat
 * )?
 * # ;
 * # // Needed for compiling for c_bindings
 * # let builder: lightning::offers::refund::RefundBuilder<_> = refund.into();
 * # let refund = builder
 * .description(\"coffee\".to_string())
 * .payer_note(\"refund for order 1234\".to_string())
 * .build()?;
 * let bech32_refund = refund.to_string();
 * 
 * First the payment will be waiting on an invoice
 * let expected_payment_id = payment_id;
 * assert!(
 * channel_manager.list_recent_payments().iter().find(|details| matches!(
 * details,
 * RecentPaymentDetails::AwaitingInvoice { payment_id: expected_payment_id }
 * )).is_some()
 * );
 * 
 * Once the invoice is received, a payment will be sent
 * assert!(
 * channel_manager.list_recent_payments().iter().find(|details| matches!(
 * details,
 * RecentPaymentDetails::Pending { payment_id: expected_payment_id, ..  }
 * )).is_some()
 * );
 * 
 * On the event processing thread
 * channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| {
 * match event {
 * Event::PaymentSent { payment_id: Some(payment_id), .. } => println!(\"Paid {}\", payment_id),
 * Event::PaymentFailed { payment_id, .. } => println!(\"Failed paying {}\", payment_id),
 * ...
 * #     _ => {},
 * }
 * Ok(())
 * });
 * # Ok(())
 * # }
 * ```
 * 
 * Use [`request_refund_payment`] to send a [`Bolt12Invoice`] for receiving the refund. Similar to
 * creating* an [`Offer`], this is stateless as it represents an inbound payment.
 * 
 * ```
 * # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider, PaymentPurpose};
 * # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
 * # use lightning::offers::refund::Refund;
 * #
 * # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T, refund: &Refund) {
 * # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
 * let known_payment_hash = match channel_manager.request_refund_payment(refund) {

 * # Persistence
 * 
 * Implements [`Writeable`] to write out all channel state to disk. Implies [`peer_disconnected`] for
 * all peers during write/read (though does not modify this instance, only the instance being
 * serialized). This will result in any channels which have not yet exchanged [`funding_created`] (i.e.,
 * called [`funding_transaction_generated`] for outbound channels) being closed.
 * 
 * Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out `ChannelManager` than you can be with
 * [`ChannelMonitor`]. With [`ChannelMonitor`] you MUST durably write each
 * [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] before returning from
 * [`chain::Watch::watch_channel`]/[`update_channel`] or before completing async writes. With
 * `ChannelManager`s, writing updates happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other
 * `ChannelManager` operations from occurring during the serialization process). If the
 * deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the [`ChannelMonitor`] passed by reference to
 * [`read`], those channels will be force-closed based on the `ChannelMonitor` state and no funds
 * will be lost (modulo on-chain transaction fees).
 * 
 * Note that the deserializer is only implemented for `(`[`BlockHash`]`, `[`ChannelManager`]`)`, which
 * tells you the last block hash which was connected. You should get the best block tip before using the manager.
 * See [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for more details.
 * 
 * # `ChannelUpdate` Messages
 * 
 * Note that `ChannelManager` is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
 * [`ChannelUpdate`] messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
 * spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
 * offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
 * [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
 * 
 * # DoS Mitigation
 * 
 * To avoid trivial DoS issues, `ChannelManager` limits the number of inbound connections and
 * inbound channels without confirmed funding transactions. This may result in nodes which we do
 * not have a channel with being unable to connect to us or open new channels with us if we have
 * many peers with unfunded channels.
 * 
 * Because it is an indication of trust, inbound channels which we've accepted as 0conf are
 * exempted from the count of unfunded channels. Similarly, outbound channels and connections are
 * never limited. Please ensure you limit the count of such channels yourself.
 * 
 * # Type Aliases
 * 
 * Rather than using a plain `ChannelManager`, it is preferable to use either a [`SimpleArcChannelManager`]
 * a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
 * essentially you should default to using a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], and use a
 * [`SimpleArcChannelManager`] when you require a `ChannelManager` with a static lifetime, such as when
 * you're using lightning-net-tokio.

	 * consider using the [`PaymentHash`] as the key for tracking payments. In that case, the

	 * 
	 * The provided `payment_id` is used to ensure that only one invoice is paid for the request
	 * when received. See [Avoiding Duplicate Payments] for other requirements once the payment has
	 * been sent.
	 * 
	 * To revoke the request, use [`ChannelManager::abandon_payment`] prior to receiving the

	 * # Privacy
	 * 
	 * For payer privacy, uses a derived payer id and uses [`MessageRouter::create_blinded_paths`]

	 * docs of the parameterized [`Router`], which implements [`MessageRouter`].

	 * # Limitations
	 * 
	 * Requires a direct connection to the given [`Destination`] as well as an introduction node in

	 * the responding [`Bolt12Invoice::payment_paths`].

	 * 
	 * `invoice_expiry_delta_secs` describes the number of seconds that the invoice is valid for
	 * in excess of the current time. This should roughly match the expiry time set in the invoice.
	 * After this many seconds, we will remove the inbound payment, resulting in any attempts to
	 * pay the invoice failing. The BOLT spec suggests 3,600 secs as a default validity time for

	 * Note that we use block header time to time-out pending inbound payments (with some margin
	 * to compensate for the inaccuracy of block header timestamps). Thus, in practice we will
	 * accept a payment and generate a [`PaymentClaimable`] event for some time after the expiry.
	 * If you need exact expiry semantics, you should enforce them upon receipt of
